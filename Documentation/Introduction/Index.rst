.. _what-it-does:

What does it do?
----------------

This extension detects and extracts metadata (EXIF / IPTC / XMP / ...) from
potentially thousand different file types (such as MS Word/Powerpoint/Excel
documents, PDF and images) and bring them automatically and natively to TYPO3
when uploading assets.

It works with built-in PHP functions but takes advantage of Apache Tika and
other external tools for enhanced metadata extraction.

.. _requirements:

Requirements
------------

- PHP methods: ``exif_read_data``, ``iptcparse``

Following tools are **optional** but *recommended* for best extraction results:

Apache Tika
   The Apache Tika\ |TM| toolkit detects and extracts metadata and text from
   over a thousand different file types (such as PPT, XLS, and PDF). All of
   these file types can be parsed through a single interface, making Tika useful
   for search engine indexing, content analysis, translation, and much more.

   Use of PHP method ``fsockopen`` is required when using Tika Server.

ExifTool
   ExifTool is a plateform-independant Perl library plus a command-line
   application for reading, writing and editing meta information in a wide
   variety of files. ExifTool supports many different metadata formats including
   EXIF, GPS, IPTC, XMP, JFIF, GeoTIFF, ICC Profile, Photoshop IRB, FlashPix,
   AFCP and ID3, as well as the maker notes of many digital cameras.

   ExifTool is also available as a standalone Windows executable (which does not
   require Perl) and a Macintosh OS X package.

Pdfinfo
   Pdfinfo prints the content of the "Info" dictionary (plus some other useful
   information) from a Portable Document Format (PDF) file.
